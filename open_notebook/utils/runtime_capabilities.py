"""Runtime availability probes for extraction engines.

Docling is baked into this fork's image and Crawl4AI is normally remote, but
availability still needs probing so a bad image or unavailable service fails
closed instead of silently breaking ingestion.

This lives in open_notebook.utils (not api/) because both layers need it: the
capabilities router reports it to the frontend, and the source-processing graph
must not hand content-core an engine whose runtime is absent — the engine
choice is persisted in the database and therefore outlives the environment that
made it available.
